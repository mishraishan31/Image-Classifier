# Image-Classifier
In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice, you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.

When you've completed this project, you'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labelled images. Here your network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. 

## Prerequisites
1. The Code is written in **Python 3.6.5** . If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Ensure you have the latest version of pip.
2. Additional Packages that are required are: [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [MatplotLib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), PIL and json. You can donwload them using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):
    - ```pip install numpy pandas matplotlib pil```<br/>
    or [conda](http://www.numpy.org/)
    - ```conda install numpy pandas matplotlib pil```
    
**NOTE**: In order to intall Pytorch follow the instructions given on the official site.
